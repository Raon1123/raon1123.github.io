I'm currently pursuing Ph.D degree at Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST). I graduated Cum Laude with a B.Sc. in Computer Science and Engineering from UNIST in 2022. My research focus on robust machine learning and utilization of commonsense knowledge in computer vision.

# Topic of Interest

- Robust Machine Learning and Computer Vision (primary)
- Understanding Computer Vision Model (secondary)

But, I'm not limited to above two topics. It's not a my research topic, but I'm interested in logic and history of computer science.
